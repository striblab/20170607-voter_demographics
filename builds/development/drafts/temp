As Minnesota and the rest of the country look toward cascades of upcoming off-year political races and midterm elections, the most recent presidential contest’s aftermath is still revealing new data about who voted – and who didn’t.

Minnesota saw notable drops in participation among young voters and minorities, despite being known for its high voter turnout and <a href="http://www.startribune.com/minnesota-had-the-nation-s-highest-voter-turnout-again-here-s-one-reason-why/416247753/" target="new_">leading the nation again in 2016</a>.


Nationally, there were stark declines in turnout among black voters and younger voters, according to the <a href="https://www.census.gov/newsroom/blogs/random-samplings/2017/05/voting_in_america.html" target="new_">Voting in America survey from the U.S. Census Bureau</a>, particularly in important battleground states where thin margins helped propel President Donald Trump’s historic electoral victory in November.


Black voter turnout nationwide declined about 7 percentage points compared to the 2012 iteration of the survey, while Hispanic voting held relatively steady between elections, despite immigration being a hot topic during the campaign.

In Minnesota, the survey shows turnout among voters aged 18 to 24 dropped about 5 percentage points compared to 2012. And while the black vote was up in the state, the overall minority vote crashed by nearly 11 points due to declines in Hispanic and Asian participation.

Because of high margins of error for the state-level results from this survey, those findings for Minnesota could be slightly higher or lower than what was reported.

Unfortunately, this survey is among the only public data sources to shed light on voter demographics.

The survey data shows the overall minority vote in 30 states and Washington D.C. declined, including in Minnesota where the race was closer than expected and battlegrounds like Wisconsin, Ohio, Florida, Michigan and North Carolina where Trump won by narrow margins.

Millennial voting -- those aged 18 to 34 -- had a slight uptick nationally, but fell in 19 states including Minnesota, Wisconsin, Iowa, Ohio, Michigan and Florida.

Minnesota is about 75 percent white with a median age of 37, so these declines among younger and minority voting seemingly contributed to an overall state voter turnout decrease of only a point between 2012 and 2016. Though every vote especially counted this past year, and Sec. Hillary Clinton (D) barely won historically blue Minnesota by about two points.

And with 2018 midterms on the horizon, along with several local and off-year races yet to come in 2017, it’s worth noting Minnesota’s midterm election turnout has dropped about 14 points since 2002.

Whether the youth and minority votes will recover in 2018, 2020 and beyond is uncertain, but the picture of what happened this past November gets a bit clearer as more data emerges.
